          This whole solution relies on Node.js for the server, Express for the middleware, React for the front-end framework and MariaDB for the database.<br />

          I also implemented tailwind CSS framework since I wanted to increase the efficiency in which I styled the many elements inside the front-end.<br />

          First constructed the login and authentication system, uses json web token to provide both a http cookie for the refresh token authorization header for a session.<br />

          The refresh and access token contain the userâ€™s id in the table. The expiry of the access token is 15 minutes.<br />

          We construct the schema of the database by creating a table for users, a table for their scores.A table for quizzes and questions and a table for question options.<br />

          This was to minimize data duplication and create much more efficient querying.This did come back to bite me however, when my queries became pretty complex very fast.<br />

          As I was using MariaDB I could make use of the better performance and features than MYSQL if I were to have used an object relational mapper like sequelize I would have lost the flexibility and performance of raw SQL queries<br />

          Every time, before sending an API request to the server we first send a refresh request to ensure that the token is in date and ensure the API request works seamlessly.<br />
