          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <hr />

          <p>IT is my passion; in my spare time I enjoy coding personal projects.
            Comfortable working as part of a team or independently I have a can do attitude and am a fast learner. A company that gave me the opportunity to develop my skills, would find me a loyal and dedicated worker.</p>

          <h2>Experience</h2>

          <hr />

          <h3>Workshop Technician â€¢ ITChampion</h3>

          <p><em>March &#8208; August 2020</em> </p>

          <p>At ITChampion my duties included diagnosis, repair, build, and configuration of client specific PCs and phones. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I was regularly in charge of the workshop; co-ordinating and distributing workload between my colleagues,
            An example of a rather complex client specific setup I had to do was on a surface pro laptop. The client insisted on having a bitlocker pin and TPM verification in which I had to edit group policy settings and use cmdlets in PowerShell to allow a preboot on-screen keyboard.
          </p>

          <p>
            I would also liaise with our company&apos;s suppliers; handling warranties, repairs, and returns. I was also very proactive on service degradation on any of our client&apos;s platforms.
            Occasionally. I would also handle support calls for password resets and PC problems via our RMM (ConnectWise).
          </p>

          <p>I was very vigilant about the level of authorisation a particular client from a company had and curated a VIP list consisting of those who had the most authorisation within their respective organisations and companies.</p>
