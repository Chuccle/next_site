          <p>
            IT is my passion; in my spare time I enjoy coding
            personal projects. Comfortable working as part of a team
            or independently I have a can do attitude and am a fast
            learner. A company that gave me the opportunity to
            develop my skills, would find me a loyal and dedicated
            worker.
